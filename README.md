# BK-fighter-3D

BK-fighter-3D is a 3D fighting game built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. This project aims to create an immersive and performant fighting game experience in the browser.

## Features

- 3D graphics powered by Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Responsive design for various screen sizes and devices
- Optimized performance for smooth gameplay
- Character selection and customization
- Dynamic lighting and special effects
- Multiplayer support (coming soon)

## Performance Optimizations

We've implemented several optimizations to ensure smooth gameplay across various devices:

1. Efficient rendering using React.memo and useMemo
2. Object pooling for particles and other frequently created/destroyed objects
3. Level of Detail (LOD) for character models
4. Optimized asset loading and management
5. Adaptive resolution scaling based on device performance
6. Custom shaders for improved rendering efficiency
7. Touch input optimization for mobile devices

For more details on our optimization strategies, please see the [optimization documentation](doc/optimization.md).

# BK-fighter-3D Optimization Guide

This document outlines the various optimization techniques implemented in BK-fighter-3D to ensure smooth gameplay across different devices.

## Renderer Optimization

- **WebGL2 Renderer**: Utilized for improved performance on supported devices.
- **Adaptive Resolution Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts resolution based on device performance.

## Asset Loading and Management

- **AssetLoader Class**: Centralized asset management for efficient loading and caching.
- **Texture Compression**: Reduces memory usage and improves loading times.
- **Mipmapping**: Enhances rendering performance for textures at different distances.

## Object Pooling

- Implemented for frequently created/destroyed objects (e.g., projectiles, particles).
- Reduces garbage collection overhead and improves memory management.

## Level of Detail (LOD)

- LOD support for character models, switching to simpler geometries at a distance.
- Dynamic mesh simplification for less important objects.

## Occlusion Culling

- Basic occlusion culling to avoid rendering objects not visible to the camera.
- Spatial partitioning (octree) for more efficient visibility checks.

## Shader Optimization

- Custom, optimized shaders for character and environment rendering.
- Instanced rendering for repeated elements (e.g., background objects).

## Physics Optimization

- Simplified physics system for distant objects.
- Fixed timestep for physics calculations to ensure consistency across devices.

## Memory Management

- Texture atlasing to reduce draw calls and memory usage.
- Use of typed arrays for efficient data storage and manipulation.

## Frame Rate Management

- Frame rate capping to prevent excessive GPU usage on high-end devices.
- Adaptive quality settings that adjust based on the current frame rate.

## Touch Input Optimization

- Touch input prediction and smoothing for more responsive controls.
- Use of passive event listeners for touch events to improve scrolling performance.

## Future Optimization Considerations

- Implement more advanced culling techniques (e.g., portal culling for complex environments).
- Add support for WebGPU on compatible devices for even better performance.
- Implement asset streaming for large levels or open-world scenarios.
- Use Web Workers for offloading heavy computations to separate threads.
- Implement more sophisticated LOD techniques, such as geometric LOD for terrain.

By following these optimization techniques, we ensure that BK-fighter-3D provides a smooth and enjoyable experience across a wide range of devices.

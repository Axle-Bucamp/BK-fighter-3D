# BK-fighter-3D Optimization Strategies

This document outlines the optimization strategies implemented in BK-fighter-3D to ensure smooth gameplay across various devices.

## Rendering Optimizations

1. **React.memo and useMemo**: 
   - Used for pure functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implemented for expensive computations to memoize results

2. **Three.js Renderer Settings**:
   - Configured for optimal performance based on device capabilities
   - Implemented adaptive resolution scaling

3. **Custom Shaders**:
   - Created optimized shaders for character and environment rendering
   - Implemented instanced rendering for repeated elements

4. **Level of Detail (LOD)**:
   - Added LOD support for character models
   - Implemented dynamic mesh simplification for less important objects

5. **Occlusion Culling**:
   - Basic implementation to avoid rendering objects not visible to the camera
   - Used spatial partitioning (octree) for efficient visibility checks

## Asset Management

1. **AssetManager Class**:
   - Centralized asset loading and caching
   - Prevents duplicate loading of assets

2. **Texture Optimization**:
   - Implemented texture compression and mipmapping
   - Created texture atlases to reduce draw calls

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Simplified geometries for distant objects
   - Implemented progressive loading for larger assets

## Memory Management

1. **Object Pooling**:
   - Implemented for frequently created/destroyed objects (e.g., projectiles, particles)
   - Reduces garbage collection overhead

2. **Typed Arrays**:
   - Used for efficient data storage and manipulation

3. **Asset Unloading**:
   - System to unload unused assets and free up memory (planned feature)

## Physics and Game Logic

1. **Simplified Physics**:
   - Implemented a basic physics system for distant objects
   - Used fixed timestep for physics calculations

2. **Efficient Algorithms**:
   - Optimized collision detection and response algorithms
   - Implemented spatial partitioning for more efficient collision checks

## Input Handling

1. **Touch Input Optimization**:
   - Implemented touch input prediction and smoothing
   - Used passive event listeners for improved scrolling performance

## Performance Monitoring

1. **Frame Rate Management**:
   - Implemented frame rate capping to prevent excessive GPU usage
   - Added adaptive quality settings based on current frame rate

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Integrated basic performance monitoring tools (planned feature)

## Future Optimizations

1. Implement more advanced culling techniques (e.g., portal culling for complex environments)
2. Add support for WebGPU on compatible devices
3. Implement asset streaming for large levels or open-world scenarios
4. Use Web Workers for offloading heavy computations to separate threads
5. Implement more sophisticated LOD techniques, such as geometric LOD for terrain

By following these optimization strategies, we aim to provide a smooth and responsive gameplay experience across a wide range of devices. Contributors are encouraged to keep these guidelines in mind when making changes or additions to the project.

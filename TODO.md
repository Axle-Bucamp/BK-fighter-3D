   - Ensure consistent coding style and naming conventions
   - Optimize performance-critical sections
   - Remove any redundant or dead code

2. Update all function docstrings
   - Clearly describe the purpose of each function
   - Document input parameters and their types
   - Specify return values and their types
   - Note any side effects or important considerations

3. Perform recursive function checks
   - Verify that all function calls have the correct number and type of arguments
   - Ensure that called functions exist and are imported correctly
   - Check that return values are used appropriately

4. Improve 3D game logic functions
   - Enhance character movement and actions in 3D space
   - Refine collision detection for 3D objects
   - Optimize 3D rendering and camera controls

5. Review and enhance asynchronous functions
   - Ensure proper use of async/await or Promises
   - Implement robust error handling for asynchronous operations

6. Audit event listeners
   - Verify that event listeners are set up and removed properly
   - Prevent potential memory leaks

7. Ensure consistent state management across components
   - Implement a centralized state management system if not already in place
   - Verify that game state updates are propagated correctly

8. Review and secure data storage
   - Audit any use of localStorage or sessionStorage
   - Implement encryption for sensitive data if necessary

9. Create a constants file
   - Move hardcoded values to a centralized constants file
   - Ensure all configurable values are easily accessible and modifiable

3. Design and implement power-ups and special abilities
   - Create unique power-ups that appear during matches
   - Develop special moves for each character

4. Add environmental interactions
   - Implement destructible objects in the game world
   - Create interactive elements that affect gameplay

5. Enhance the UI/UX
   - Design and implement a more intuitive main menu
   - Create engaging victory/defeat screens
   - Add options for control customization

6. Implement a replay system
   - Allow players to save and watch their matches
   - Add functionality to share replays online

7. Create a tutorial system
   - Develop an interactive tutorial for new players
